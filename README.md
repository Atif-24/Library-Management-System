# Library Management System

This Library Management System is a basic project created to learn the fundamentals of C++ and develop a useful program to keep track of the books you have read. It utilizes a CSV file as the data storage format, leveraging the simplicity and convenience of CSV files for simple tasks. While handling CSV files may be easier in languages like Python, they still function well in this C++ project.

## Introduction

This project served as my initial introduction to C++. Coming from a background in C, I found many similarities between the two languages while also discovering differences along the way. 

During my learning journey, I had also dabbled in Python and found its for loop to be simpler and more concise. However, I decided to embrace the C++ approach in this project, combining my familiarity with C and my preference for using curly brackets.

## Features

- **Add a Book**: Users can add a new book to the library by providing details such as the book's title, author, publication year, genre, and ISBN-13.
- **Remove a Book**: Users can remove a book from the library by selecting the book based on its row number.
- **Search for a Book**: Users can search for books by title, author, or genre and view the details of matching books.
- **View all Books**: Users can view all the books in the library.
- **Data Persistence**: The library data is stored in a CSV file (`library.csv`), ensuring that the data is retained between program executions.

## Getting Started

To run the Library Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management.git`
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled program.

## Usage

Upon running the program, a menu will be displayed with the following options:

1. Add a Book
2. Remove a Book
3. Search for a Book
4. View all Books
5. Quit

Select the desired option by entering the corresponding number. Follow the prompts to perform the selected operation.

## Data Format

The library data is stored in a CSV file (`library.csv`). Each line represents a book, and the fields are separated by commas. The fields in each line are as follows:

```
Title, Author, Year Published, Genre, ISBN
```

Ensure that you adhere to this format when manually modifying the CSV file.

## Feedback

All feedback for this project is welcome! This was a very basic project, but it serves as a tool I am using to keep track of my library. Any bugs or suggestions for simple features to add are welcome!

## Acknowledgments

- The program was developed as a learning project to gain a better understanding of C++ and create a practical tool for managing books.
- Thanks to the creators of the C++ programming language and the libraries used in this project.
